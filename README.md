# Text-Minesweeper
A simple Minesweeper game in text format in Python
Please note that i am a beginner to prgramming and i just started coding. This project was made for exercise.

Its not totally Minesweeper because you have to get a certain amount of fields right to win, but i will make changes in the future to change this

To play the game just start Minesweeper.py in the same folder as mine_ui_check.py and it should work
